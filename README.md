# US Medical Insurance Costs Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes medical insurance costs in the United States, focusing on how various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region impact insurance premiums. The project includes an interaction analysis between smoking status and the number of children.

## Data
The data used in this project is from a CSV file (`insurance.csv`), which includes information on age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

## Files in This Repository
- **`us-medical-insurance-costs-refined.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with the refined code and analysis.
- **`insurance_refined.csv`**: Cleaned and processed data.
- **`model_summary.txt`**: Summary of the regression model used in the analysis.
- **`README.md`**: This file, describing the project and its contents.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies needed to run the code.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis on your machine:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `us-medical-insurance-costs-refined.ipynb` and run the cells to see the analysis.
